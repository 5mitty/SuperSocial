## Description

Welcome to SocialConnect, a full-stack web application that simulates a social media platform. This project showcases my expertise in designing and implementing a scalable database using MongoDB, as well as creating a seamless user experience. There's the ability for creating users, thoughts, friends and reactions. The application also features a commenting system, allowing users to engage with each other's thoughts. Throughout the development of SocialConnect, I gained valuable experience in database modeling, API design, and security best practices. This project demonstrates my ability to build complex, data-driven applications that meet the demands of modern social media platforms.
